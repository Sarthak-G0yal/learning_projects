# MIPS Assembly

This folder contains the complete collection of code developed during my Computer Architecture course in the third semester of college. The code examples and projects within this repository reflect a deep engagement with MIPS assembly language, fundamental computer architecture concepts, and hands-on application of theoretical knowledge.
