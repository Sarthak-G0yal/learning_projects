# Stone Paper Scissor
<br>
<p>This is my first project in python where i have created the classic "Stone Paper Scissor" Game using Python.</p>
<p>The logic is simple and straight forward.</p>
<p>You can easly understand this just by looking at the code.</p>
<br><br>
<p>Note - I used pyinstaller module to convert python script into executable file.</p>
